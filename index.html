        <h1>Social Structures in Star Wars</h1>

		<p class="text">
			If you have seen the Star Wars movie, you know that the social structures within are constructed in some interesting and complex ways. 
			On this site we look at how these people are connected
		</p>
		<p class="text">
			Withing Star Wars there are multiple different societies on different planets, political alliances and family relationships.
			We thought it would be fun to look at these different kinds of way people are connected - which one is the most dominant? Are there some hidden ways the characters are connected?
			Let's find out!
		</p>
		<p class="text">
			We also know that some key character, such as Luke Skywalker, is connected to a lot of other characters and key in almost every movie.
			We wanted to look at some of these key characters and study how their social structures are constructed and developed throughout the movies.
		</p>
		<p class="text">
			We also thought it could be fun to look at the semantics of the different movies to see if we from this would be able to guess the plot of the movie.
			Maybe this could also reveal a shift in semantics over time or reveal key events that had a significant impact on the movie.

			Feel free to look around. Our explainer notebook is also available at "Behind the data" to get a deep dive into our process.

			<p>The website should contain your analysis, it should tell the story about the data that you're interested in getting across. The website should not be technical, but rather aim at using visualization and explanation to get your insights across to a non-scientific reader.</p>
			<p>This should be: Introduction to problem, why is it exciting, what is the goal of this site</p>
			<p>Also remember this: There should be download options for data sets (so the user can play around). You must link to the Explainer Notebook (more details below) that explains the details of your analysis (including all of the machine learning, the model selection, etc). You can achieve this with a link to a notebook displaying on the nbviewer.</p>
			<p>Action plan:</p>
			<ul>
			  <li>Plot with different groupings (including Louvain algorithm) (with modularity)</li>
			  <li>Wordcloud - most used words for each grouping</li>
			  <li>Possibly create links through episode summaries</li>
			  <li>Temporal effect - how important character links develop</li>
			  <li>Undirected/directed graph</li>
			  <li>Which words are used the most throughout all of the star wars movies?</li>
			  <li>Word frequency for each episode</li>
			  <li>Semantic analysis?</li>
			</ul>
