			<p>The website should contain your analysis, it should tell the story about the data that you're interested in getting across. The website should not be technical, but rather aim at using visualization and explanation to get your insights across to a non-scientific reader.</p>

			<p>Also remember this: There should be download options for data sets (so the user can play around). You must link to the Explainer Notebook (more details below) that explains the details of your analysis (including all of the machine learning, the model selection, etc). You can achieve this with a link to a notebook displaying on the nbviewer.</p>
