			If you have seen the Star Wars movie, you know that the social structures within are constructed in some interesting and complex ways. 
			On this site we look at how these people are connected
		</p>
		<p class="text">
			Withing Star Wars there are multiple different societies on different planets, political alliances and family relationships.
			We thought it would be fun to look at these different kinds of way people are connected - which one is the most dominant? Are there some hidden ways the characters are connected?
			Let's find out!
		</p>
		<p class="text">
			We also know that some key character, such as Luke Skywalker, is connected to a lot of other characters and key in almost every movie.
			We wanted to look at some of these key characters and study how their social structures are constructed and developed throughout the movies.
		</p>
		<p class="text">
			We also thought it could be fun to look at the semantics of the different movies to see if we from this would be able to guess the plot of the movie.
			Maybe this could also reveal a shift in semantics over time or reveal key events that had a significant impact on the movie.
			Together with this we would want to analyze the words that each group use. What are the words from each group dominated by? Are there a significant different in the words used in different groups?
