        <h1>Analyzing Star Wars movie scripts</h1>
		<div class="text-content">
			<p>In this part, we will analyze the movie scripts from Star Wars and the social structures within. To see more information about the dataset using in this section, go to "Behind The Data".</p>

		<h2>Finding key characters</h2> 
		<div class="text-content">
			<p>Before making temporal graphs for the key character, we need to find which characters are key. Ofcource, we do have our assumptions, but to be sure we are right, we will do some analysis. This can be done by analyzing the movie scripts. We make the assumption that the characters with the most dialogues with other characters, are key characters. We can do this for each episode: </p>

			<p>Here the 10 characters with the most interactions with others are seen for each episode.</p>
			<p>We can determine some key characters that have the most dialogues with other characters as: Luke, C-3PO (Threepio), Vader, Han and Leia.</p>
			<p>We will therefore study how their social structure developes throughout these 3 episodes of the movie.</p>

            <p>The table on the left shows how Luke's relationsships develop over the 3 episodes (movie 4, 5 and 6). The procent increase is compared to Episode 4.</p>

			  </table>			  
			<p>C-3PO also known as 'Threepio' sees a similar pattern as Luke although the procentwise growth is larger. This is mainly due to C-3PO not having conversations with many others that Luke in the first movie. C-3PO has the second most dialogues just under Luke, but the number of relationships is very small.</p>
        </div>

			  </table>			  
            <p>The growth continues to go up. Vader has more relationships than C-3PO, but less than Luke in the first movie, however we do see an significant increase in relationsships in movie 5 and 6, although he is the main character with the least amount of dialogues. This suggest Vader does not speak and are not as present as the other characters, but when he is, it if often with people he has not been seen in with before.</p>

			  </table>			  
			<p>Han has a massive boost in relationships in Episode 5. This is mainly due to him not being as present in the fourth movie, but the third most active in the third movie. The procentwise increase is therefore overly exactered compared to the actual number of relationsships precisely for that reason.</p>

			<p>Leia sees the exact same pattern as Han in the fourth movie. She is not as present in the fourth movie as Han, but more present in the fifth movie, and the growth of social relationssips therefore growths more smoothly.</p>

			<p>It seems that all characters end up having the (very close to) same number of connections at the end. We can see that they do not have the same amount of dialogues, which means some people interact more with each other than others (we can imagine Luke and Threepio have a pretty strong connection and a lot of dialogues together.)</p>
        </div>
		<div class="text-content">
			The table above proves the analysis made for each of the main characters. Luke is having many conversations with many different people. C-3PO has a bunch of conversation, but that with as many different people. Vader has the least amount of dialogues, but second most relationsships. Leia and Han have least amount of relationsships, but han with double the amount of dialogues. This matches the storyline in the movies. But now the interesting part: What are they actually saying? What are the tone, main word, etc? Let's find out:
		</div>
		<div class="h-line"></div>
		<h2>Word Analysis: </h2> 

		<div class="text-content">
			<p>To see more on how we made this word analysis, see our notebook at "Behind the data".</p>
		</div>

		<div class="text-content">
			<p>
				After looking at how the different characters connect with the help of our graphs, we'll now take a look at how the different characters are explaind through their most "frequent" (TF-IDF) words. But first we'll try to do the same for each episode IV, V and VI.
			</p>
			<p>
				To achieve these bar plots, we did have to do a little tinkering, since there really wasn't enough documents to perform a proper TF-IDF analysis, so we opted to compare/cross-reference the words with the news section of the nltk brown corpus. This way we could get a better idea of what words were unique to the Star Wars universe both within and oustide the context of the movies. Below you'll see the bar plots with the brown corpus words left 
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="text-content">
			<p>
				But as you can probably see, many of these words are not really that unique to the Star Wars universe, and instead originate from the nltk dataset we artificially included. But we found that simply removing the words from the brown corpus from the bar plots, we could get a much better idea of what words were unique to the Star Wars universe. Below you'll see the bar plots with the brown corpus words removed:
			</p>
		</div>
		<img src="movieScriptTFIDF.png" alt="Test Image">
		<div class="text-content">
			<p>
				There are some clear characteristics you can observe for each of the movies. In episode IV, we know that there is a very big focus on Luke, Obi-wan Kenobi, his two droids C-3PO and R2-D2. This is also reflected in the plot, where we see all these characters except C3-PO mentioned. And besides that the main "mission" is also clearly seen, being that of bringing "Artoo" to the "planet", "Alderaan".
			</p>	
			<p>
				In episode V, we know that Luke, Han Solo, Chewbacca and Leia are together throughout a lot of the movie, and we meet the main antagonist Darth Vader. This is also somewhat reflected in the plot, where we see the names of "chewie", "vader", "luke". We also see "lando" the name of a secondary character, but who is also a big part of the movie. This movie is also the first time the characters travel a lot between planets which is reflected in the plot with words like "light-speed" and "hyperdrive".
			</p>	
			<p>
				In episode VI, we see much of the same as in episode V since we've been introduced too all the main and secondary main characters, except for the notable new addition, "Jabba" who is a major antagonist in the movie.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="text-content">
			<p>
				Now that we've looked at how the different episodes are characterized by these plots, we'll now take a look at how the different characters are characterized by the plots. We'll take a look at the 5 main characters Luke, Leia, Han Solo, C3-PO and Darth Vader.
			</p>
		</div>
		<img src="movieScriptTFIDF_characters.png" alt="Test Image">
		<div class="text-content">
			<p>
				When looking at these plots it instantly becomes apparent where some of the words from the episode plots come from. For example, we see that C3-PO is characterized by words like "Oh", "Ohhh", "Uh", "Sir", which also make an appearance in all three episodes. And makes sense for C3-PO since his a scaredy-cat.

				For Luke and Leia we see similar plots, with the names of the main cast mentioned the most.
			</p>
			<p>
				For Han Solo, we see a lot of casual exclamations "Hey", "Yeah", "Okay", "Huh", "What", "Gonna" etc. which makes sense for his character, since he's a very casual and laid back character. And he also mentions Chewie, his partner, a lot.
				
				For Darth Vader, we see a lot of words related to military, "Emperor", "Admiral", "betray", "asteroid", "dark", etc. And his enemy "Obi-wan" and him and his sons last name "Skywalker".
